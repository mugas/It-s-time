## Clock and Time Zones - It's Time to Quit

A clock made with <strong>JS</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>.
For the digital clock I worked with <em>momentjs</em>.

This was my third project, but the first one that was based on a tutorial. After I did the tutorial from <strong>[Wes Bos( 30 days of Javascript)](https://javascript30.com/)</strong> - <em>CSS +JS clock</em> and because the use of time in JS was daunting to me, I decided that I had to give it a go.
In the middle of the project I learned about the library <em>momentjs</em> and also ended up using it in the digital clock.

This project made me want to try different things in javascript and learn more about it and also about libraries.
When I was almost done with the project, the clock was a little bit rustic with no background and I was checking how it looked on my cellphone and had the idea of putting a cigar on the back with the clock waving and giving the title <em>It's Time to Quit</em>.


In JS I worked and learn with:

<ul>
<li>Functions</li>
<li>Scopes</li>
<li>Methods</li>
<li>Libraries</li>
<li>Time variables</li>
</ul>

In CSS I worked and learn with:

<ul>
<li>Animations</li>
<li>Variables</li>
<li>Positions</li>
<li>Libraries</li>
</ul>
